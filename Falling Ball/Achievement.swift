 The rubric didn't specifically ask for a comment but I figured I'd add one in just in case.
 I'll ACTUALLY keep this short.
 Basically I save each achievement's progress (as an int) to the UserDefaults dictionary on the device (along with whether or not it's been earned).
 Each achievement also has a "threshold" to meet so the progress can be shown.
 Setting the progress is self explanitory for each achievement (i.e. for the number of games the number is increased after a game is ended).
 Each achievement is a static variable so I can access them all everywhere.
 A notification pops up when you get an achievement.
 That's basically it. Nothing too fancy but setting up the data model took a lot of thinking to make it efficient.
 Have fun!
